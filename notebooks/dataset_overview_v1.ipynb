The said building currently has four wings, with 36 flats, and is more the 40 years since its construction leading it to be in very in very dilapidated condition and non-repairable.\\r\\nIt is very difficult for us to stay in such a dilapidated condition, and we live in a constant fear of building collapse. It is almost 6 years now that we had made application for NOC and no action has been taken by Railway. The Railways have neither issue us the NOC nor given any concrete factual answers backed with documentation as to why NOC cant be given.\\r\\nWe say that right from the day when we made an application for the said NOC, there is a lethargic attitude on the part of the railways and its officers on ground. It is to be noted that there is an obligation on the railways to issue NOC, within 6 months of such application, yet it has been almost 6 years after we made an application and are still awaiting the said NOC from the railways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n","This is to bring to your information that my mother Mrs Sumitra Gupta opened an account under SCS scheme for Rs 2 Lakhs on 16/3/2020 at yojna vihar PO which comes under Krishna Ngr PO. The amount (2 lacs) was duly collected by the Yojna Vihar PO and she was given the Receipt which mentioned the Account Details (X7X4X2X3X8). She had been receiving quarterly interest till June 2021, after which it stopped suddenly. Upon enquiry, we were told that account is on hold as there is a dispute going on because of a mistake by postmaster. He had given same account number to two applicants at the time of account opening. Since then she hasnt been getting interest and cant even withdraw her own money.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter multiple visits to Yojna Vhr PO and writing multiple mails to concerned authority nothing happened and we were asked to visit Krishna nagar PO. Case was forwarded to ASP on 8th Oct 2021 but not yet resolved. Then, on 7th Feb 2022, we were told that it will take one more month to settle the account. We have been trying to register our concern on the website, but it doesnt work only.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Father, an elderly man of 82 years age has visited Yojna Vihar post office multiple times but always sent back with reassurance. Unfortunately, that reassurance cannot fulfill his financial needs.\\r\\nwe are just asking that we should be able to withdraw our money which we have deposited.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur case was closed on 22nd Sep 2022 mentioning that it is under enquiry and we will be notified once enquiry is complete. THAT IS THE PROBLEM. For more than one year enquiry has been going on, no resolution and we cannot use our own money deposited in a government account. If the enquiry process had been working.. I wouldnt have raised an issue with PM office. No resolution to our concerns after complaining at delhi CMO office and PM office also\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all this, we received a circular from post office to pay them the interest amount they had given us. My concern is, that we have received some partial interest amount which was rightfully ours and have not received any interest thereon. They are supposed to reopen our account and pay us the balance interest amount. Why are they asking for a payment from us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, the reply document given by concerned authority belongs to some other person. The same mistake being repeated, which was done at the time of account opening.      1\n","Dear Sir/madam,\\r\\nThis has reference to my previous complaint no.\\r\\nXPX/X/X0X2X8X7X3 regarding non receipt of rent/office maintenance expenses whatever the postal department calls it. I have not received any communication from the department other letter attached in reply to this complain which itself looks fake as there is no date on attached reply letter. How your department is able to close the complain with undated letter and without accutally informing the complainant. The letter of office maintenance expenses for earlier period was already attached for reference for doing the needful. Does it mean that Department of Posts is not going to pay the office maintenance expenses and why there is so much delay in payment ever after sending several reminders and visiting to office.. Is there anyones personal Interest is involved in this..\\r\\n\\r\\nKindly do the needful at earliest and check the genuines of the letter before closing the complain and confirm that the reply has
